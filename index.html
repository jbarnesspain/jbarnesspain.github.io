	<h1>Hi there, my name's Jeremy Barnes!</h1>
				<p>I'm a PhD student at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. I do work on cross-lingual sentiment and emotion analysis,
        especially for under-resourced languages. I believe speakers of all languages deserve to have their voices
        heard and this is my small piece of sand that I can bring to the table. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
