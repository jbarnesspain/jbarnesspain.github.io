	<h2>Hi there, my name's Jeremy Barnes!</h2><br><br>
	
	I'm a PhD student at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. I do work on cross-lingual sentiment and emotion analysis,
        especially for under-resourced languages. I believe speakers of all languages deserve to have their voices
        heard and this is my small way of chipping in. <a href="/about">More information about me</a>
