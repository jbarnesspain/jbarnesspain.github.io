So, you've decided to get to know me a bit better then? Here's me in a nutshell.<br><br>
	
  I was always interested in languages, but a undergrad Latin course convinced me that languages were a world that I needed to explore deeper. I studied linguistics and began to learn languages. After spending a year in Germany, I moved
  to Spain and studied Spanish, Basque and Catalan.<br><br>
  
	I did my Master's at <a href="https://www.upf.edu">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a> in Barcelona on Emotion Detection and now I'm doing my PhD on cross-lingual
sentiment analysis for under-resourced languages.
