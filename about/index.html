title: A bit about me

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>So, you've decided to get to know me a bit better then? Here's me in a nutshell.</h1>
	<p>I was always interested in languages, but a undergrad Latin course convinced me that languages were a world that 
  I needed to explore. I studied linguistics and began to learn languages. After spending a year in Germany, I moved
  to Spain and studied Spanish, Basque and Catalan.</p>
  
<p>I did my Master's at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona on Emotion Detection and now I'm doing my PhD on cross-lingual
sentiment analysis for under-resourced languages.
