Our paper "On the effect of word order on cross-lingual sentiment" won best paper award at [SEPLN 2019](http://hitz.eus/sepln2019/)! This work derives from Àlex R. Atrio's Master's thesis, which I was co-supervisor for. Àlex is now at HEIG-VD and EPFL in Switzerland doing his PhD. His first publication and already an award. Congrats!
